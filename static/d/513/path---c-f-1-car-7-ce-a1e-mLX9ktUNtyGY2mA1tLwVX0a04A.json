The F1 car can be printed in PLA and is designed so that everybody will be able to print and build it without any hassle. Even a ball bearing kit is now available <a href=\"http://www.fasteddybearings.com/openrc-f1-sealed-bearing-kit/\">http://www.fasteddybearings.com/openrc-f1-sealed-bearing-kit/</a> for the car :- )</p>\n<p>I created some rain tires for the original rims but I also designed these low profile rim/tires just for fun. The low profile tires feature a new snap-on design that will secure the tire using a triangular shape that´s interconnecting the parts. Also the tires are not sealed with this design, making them a bit softer since the air is not trapped inside (but I also included a solid version).</p>\n<p>This snap-on design is also available for tires/rims that can be used with the OpenR/C Touring Car or similar RC cars naturally.</p>\n<p>Download the Touring rims here: <a href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1001223\">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1001223</a> and the tires here: <a href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1001233\">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1001233</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Please also check out my unuiqe UV-stable, flexible and conductive filament called ETPU 95-250 Carbon Black filament.</p>\n<p>Don´t need the conductivity? Well the conductivity is great for some things but perhaps not your first choice? Then consider this:</p>\n<p>This filament will give you some really nice benefits if the conductivity is not an disadvantage for your 3D printed design:</p>\n<p>•The material composition eliminates “stringing / webbing” issues.\n•The hardness of 95 shore A and the carbon black filler makes for great print abilities.\n•The carbon black filler is an excellent UV stabilizer thus the prints are built to last in very harsh environments.\n•The matte black surface finish has a very exclusive look.\n•The material feels very nice and dry to touch.\n•It´s not too stretchy and will do great for timing belts etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://rubber3dprinting.com/\">http://rubber3dprinting.com/</a>\n<a href=\"http://palmiga.com/\">http://palmiga.com/</a></p>\n<p>Follow me on Instagram and/or twitter:\n<a href=\"http://instagram.com/rubber3dprinting\">http://instagram.com/rubber3dprinting</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rubber3dprint\">https://twitter.com/rubber3dprint</a></p>\n<p>For more info regarding release of the F1 car and also the other Open-RC project head over in this direction: <a href=\"http://danielnoree.com/\">http://danielnoree.com/</a>\nFor OpenR/C Formula 1 print-files (after release) go here: <a href=\"https://pinshape.com/users/18846-danielnoree\">https://pinshape.com/users/18846-danielnoree</a>\nFor my designs check out <a href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/Palmiga/designs\">http://www.thingiverse.com/Palmiga/designs</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rubber3dprinting/\">https://www.instagram.com/rubber3dprinting/</a></p>\n<p>Due to the nature of 3D printing / material used etc...
