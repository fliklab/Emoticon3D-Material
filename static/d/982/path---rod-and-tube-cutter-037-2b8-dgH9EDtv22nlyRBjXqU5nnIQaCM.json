{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This is a tool to cut small diameter rods or tubes using a Dremel. I use it with a Dremel 395. It has the Dremel thread (M18x2,25/ANSI 3/4-12) in the guide part, so you can just easily screw the Dremel in. You will need a small tube or rod with a 10mm diameter to connect the two parts. The guide part might need some sanding to fit in the base, I wanted it to fit nicely with little play.</p>\n<p>I also made a non-metric version for the hinge. You can use a 3/8\" axle for the hinge instead of the 10mm axle. The files with \"_38\" in the filename are the 3/8\" axle version. I hope the tolerances are okay to fit the axle in.</p>\n<p>Also added a support-block, for supporting the loose end of the tube/rod to be cut.</p>\n<p>EDIT 2019/01/26\nI added the .step files for the 3/8\" hinge version, so everyone is free to make their own mods.</p>\n<p>EDIT 2019/02/04\nModified the base part, so the flex guide part would not collide anymore with the base. Since I don't have the flexible extension for the Dremel, I cannot test the flex guide part.\nIf you are using the regular guide or guide_38 part you are fine, nothing to change.</p>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"This is a tool to cut small diameter rods or tubes using a Dremel.
