Maybe someone will find this project usefull. Easy to print and assemble and gives you a really good result.\n775 motor is super cheap and powerful motor that has high torque and can be used in any robotics project, some people even build saws and lawn mowers with this motor! This gear gives you even higher torque :)</p>\n<p>Here you can buy 775 motor: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/qog5xj\">https://goo.gl/qog5xj</a></p>\n<p>Ender 3 3D printer: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/cVitRn\">https://goo.gl/cVitRn</a></p>\n<p>Subscribe to my channel: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/x6Y32E\">https://goo.gl/x6Y32E</a></p>\n<p>Check out everything 3D printing related by me: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/27FcVu\">https://goo.gl/27FcVu</a></p>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"This is a simple model of gear for 775 motor that I designed to test how durable it is.
