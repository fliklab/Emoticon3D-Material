Dodge would be the second manufacturer to unveil their new car, but 10 days before the unveiling their anchor team defected to Ford. The car was unveiled as scheduled anyway and made one more public appearance but Dodge was unable to sign a new team so the car was hidden away in a warehouse. There were just enough photos taken at these two events for me to reconstruct the car digitally.</p>\n<h1 id=\"print-the-body-with-support-4-wheels-and-4-pins\"><a href=\"#print-the-body-with-support-4-wheels-and-4-pins\" aria-label=\"print the body with support 4 wheels and 4 pins permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Print the body with support, 4 wheels, and 4 pins.</h1>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"This is a 1/24th scale model of the 2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup Dodge Charger, as accurate as I could make it.The short version: NASCAR announced…","frontmatter":{"title":"2013 Charger Race Car","cover":"car_model_img_file6","date":null,"category":null,"tags":["charger","dodge","미니어쳐","장난감"]},"fields":{"slug":"/2013-charger-race-car","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2013-charger-race-car","nexttitle":"Flywheel Toy Car","nextslug":"/flywheel-toy-car","prevtitle":"Formula E Race Car","prevslug":"/formula-e-race-car"}}
