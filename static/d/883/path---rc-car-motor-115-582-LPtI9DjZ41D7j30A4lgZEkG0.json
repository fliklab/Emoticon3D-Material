You will need to sand the parts down to fit so the better your 3D Printer is calibrated the less you'll need to sand. Have fun with printing this if anyone will that is. Mine is printing right now and I'll update it with photos when I'm done.</p>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"This is a 2.5cc gas RC engine.
