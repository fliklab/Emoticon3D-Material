#I love my iPhone 6 plus, but is is too big for a car's cup holder. I hate adapters where you have to "install" the phone before you drive off, so I created Mad Rabbit, just drop in your phone and drive!
Hope you like it.
#Version 2.0 is here with 10% less plastic, screw-on heads and stronger body !!
#FEATURES
#There are 3 main parts: HEAD, BODY and ARMS
#HEAD: Designed to fit your phone with a light case (incipio, apple silicone case, etc). There are 3 head sizes: iPhone 5, 6 and 6plus. Print the right one for your phone.
#BODY: Screw with the HEAD of your choice.
#Note: I designed the ARMS's diameter for my car, if you want me to make a version for your own car just ask :) just remember to send me the diameter of the cup holder in centimetres.
#TIP: You can stick strips of blue masking tape on the inside of the phone holder (bunny ears) so that they provide additional grip and protection for your phone.
