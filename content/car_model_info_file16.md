#This antique car is not a specific model, but a stereotypical car from the late 1950s. I started with the general shape of the car, then added some features, such as the lights, bumper and windows.
I have always enjoyed making model cars and airplanes, so I made this as a small addition. My interest in old car models is a Ford Thunderbird that my grandfather owns. Although not operational, I hope that it will be rebuilt someday.
#Upload the stl. file onto the makerbot. I found that standing the car on its side is best, scince all the features on that side turned out alright. The only trouble could be the wheels on the side not flush with the board. Although they stayed attached for my car, they could be messed up. If so, just cut off the defective wheels and make replacements, which are pretty simple.
