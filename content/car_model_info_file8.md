#Simple add-on parts to modify any diecast car for any postapocalyptic racing game. Scales well with ~1:64 original Matchbox scale. Primarly designed for Gaslands but can be used for any other games as well.
#Additional elements will be added in a timely manner...
Splitting into separate theme-based things (barrels, rams, armour, motors, etc.) was requested but this will take a little bit of time in reorganization.

#Should be printed at 0.1 due to the fragile nature of the objects.
#Some tiny things like air inlets for the motors can/should be printed with even smaller resolution.
#Parts are designed to be printed without any supports... Please check the splicer results before printing before some parts are barely above the 0.4mm nozzle width...
