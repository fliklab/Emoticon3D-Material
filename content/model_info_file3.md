Timber Wolf 3D model, or MadCat 3D model as it is known by gamers, is a fast and heavy bipedal vehicle engaged in the battles that take place in the BattleTech Universe of the popular video game. This machine has more aggressive looks than the Catapult 3D model. Its design is a cross-over between the Marauder and the Catapult model designs, thus its name MadCat.

The in-game model is a powerful weapon in combats. It can shoot close and far-range fire. Equipped with powerful weaponry and heavy armor, it is inconceivable how this seventy five tons mech could move swiftly on the battlefield and take part in most assaults.

Just as with Catapult 3D printing gaming figurine, in-game MadCat can be customized with additional weaponry, as soon as the players level up.
