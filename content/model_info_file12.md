A turbine kit designed to work with Theo Jansen's AG5 and AG7 strandbeests, previously available here at shapeways.  Unfortunately both Animaris Geneticus Parvus #5 & #7 are now extinct.  If you were lucky enough to have bought one before...

Functionally similar to the official Propeller Propulsion, this addon positions the propeller/turbine on top, centrally over the strandbeest.

The addon moving parts are fitted in the gap in the middle of the strandbeest and use sections of the frame as axle and drive shaft, reducing the number of additional components

I'm quite happy about this design and the elegant way it keys into the AG5 & AG7 :)
