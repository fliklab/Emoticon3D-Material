This is a simple model of gear for 775 motor that I designed to test how durable it is. It is a part of a bigger project that I am working on now. Maybe someone will find this project usefull. Easy to print and assemble and gives you a really good result.
775 motor is super cheap and powerful motor that has high torque and can be used in any robotics project, some people even build saws and lawn mowers with this motor! This gear gives you even higher torque :)
