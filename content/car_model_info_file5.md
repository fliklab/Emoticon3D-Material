#This is a 1/24 model of the Spark Racing Technologies SRT_01E, the spec car being raced in the first year of the Formula E World Championship. It's an electric car, so it doesn't look quite like the cars built for the other major formulas as the powertrain has different strengths and weaknesses. The sidepods are small and set further back as cooling demands are lower. To reduce drag, the wings are simple with low angles of attack and there are wedges to direct air around the tires. The tires are treaded but not directional (which came out very well, I'll be doing more treaded tires in the future), and the wheels are very large for an open-wheel car.
#Print one of each part except the wheel pins (2), the Large pins (4), and the Front and Rear wheels (2 each). The tub, wings and steering wheel should be printed with support.
#The new style front wing can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1697117
#Removing support and inserting the wheel pins is even more of a pain than on the Lola. Fitting the wheel pins should be done before fitting the suspension to the car. Point the pin part towards the center hole, then use a rigid thin object against the flat side to push it past all the suspension arms. That might not make any sense, so I've included a picture. I would not recommend actually using a scissor blade for that job, or trying to do it one-handed while holding a camera with the other. Safety first!
Fit the suspension to the car before putting the wheels on.
