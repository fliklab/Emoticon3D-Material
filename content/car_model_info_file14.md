Update - Jan 24, 2014
I have removed the Large Covered hopper in anticipation of a better version dropping in the next few days. I have added the files for a 100 ton uncovered hopper in the mean time, as well as a universal truck set that I plan to use on most of my future freight car designs.

This is a small work in progress HO Scale car library. All cars are just the car bodies at the moment, so wheelsets and couplers are still required. These models are based on reference pictures from the internet and do not depict any type of car in great detail. They are a proof of concept, however they can be used on actual scale models.
