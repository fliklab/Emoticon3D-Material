#I printed the original X-wing car for my 3yo nephew and it took him all of about a day to break it, which at least shows he was playing with it :). It broke off one of the wings where the wheel was too near an edge.
#So I took the SCAD file and made some modifications:
#Shrunk the wheel holes (they were way too big).
#Tidied the code ... a lot. This was clearly a modified version of another piece of code so I stripped out the bits that weren't needed and re-wrote the code in a way that (to my view) is easier to follow and tried to comment it completely.
#Flipped the wings over. X-wings have forward swept wings for some reason.
#Split the model in 2 and added a joining piece (so it can still be printed without support).
#So here I present my derivative ...
#Print the main STL file, you can split off the joint block if you want that a different colour (mine is black on a red X-wing).
#Possibly need to drill out the axle and gun holes to 3mm.
#Print the Accessories in a contrasting colour (glow in the dark PLA works REALLY well).
#Use 3mm PLA (or something similar) as axles
#Assemble pieces, its all pretty obvious. Longer guns go at the top as the holes are not blocked by a PLA axle.
#I Glued it all together with Superglue to be sure it stayed but it will probably stay together without this.
